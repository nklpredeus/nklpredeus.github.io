							“oops!” or make any last-minute changes to your order. (If you wish to bypass the 24-hour review

							when you receive your order confirmation email.)

							facility. (Check the Production & Shipping tab on our product pages for your product’s production
							time.) Unfortunately, orders for or that include products with 1-3 day production times, as well as
							any orders requesting expedited shipping, cannot be changed.

							adjust it, we can attempt to do so before it is shipped from the production facility. If we cannot
							do so in time or you wish to cancel after production has started, you would be charged a restocking
							fee of less than the original amount of the order.</span>
