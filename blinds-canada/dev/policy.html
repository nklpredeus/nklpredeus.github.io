							POLICY
						</h1>
						<h2 class="h2-par">
							1. F.I.T. Guarantee
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">The Blinds F.I.T. Guarantee gives you the confidence to measure your
							own custom window coverings without worrying about making a mistake. If you do have a measuring
							mishap, we will remake that product to your corrected size specifications at no cost to you, other
							than a small $10 shipping fee. The only time you may incur a remake charge is if there is a
							difference in price between the original product and the remake.

							The F.I.T. Guarantee applies only to necessary remakes of a product due to customer error in
							measurements (i.e., incorrect/wrong size window measurements provided by customer on order)
							resulting in product that is made to wrong size.

							Product remakes will be made with customer’s corrected measurements applied to the original product
							ordered only. Product(s) will be remade in same style, color, features, etc., per original order.

							Requests for product remakes under guarantee must be made within 30 days of delivery date of
							original product to customer.

							Customer must provide Blinds with photo showing how product does not fit window when
							requesting remake under this guarantee.

							Remakes under this guarantee are limited to one (1) per order and a total of four (4) window
							coverings per household per customer lifetime whether for same or different product(s). If you are
							ordering multiple products and are unsure of your measurements, we recommend ordering one item to
							start so you can see how easy it is to install and feel confident that your measurements are
							correct before ordering for the rest of your windows. Any mis-measure remakes after what is covered
							in this guarantee will be made at customer cost for the price of the original order, including any
							discounts, plus an additional 10% off.

							Any product ordered outside recommended product sizes per specifications on our product pages is
							not covered.

							Bulk orders of 25 or more of the same product are not covered under this guarantee.

							Guarantee excludes motorized products, drapery/curtains and shutters.

							No cash refunds are available under this guarantee.</span>

						<h2 class="h2-par">
							2. Pricing Policy
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">Selectblinds.com strives for accuracy in all item descriptions, photographs,
							detailed specifications, pricing, links and any other product-related information contained herein
							or referenced on our website. Due to human error and other determinates we cannot guarantee that
							all item descriptions, photographs, compatibility references, detailed specifications, pricing,
							links and any other product-related information listed is entirely accurate, complete or current,
							nor can we assume responsibility for these errors. In the event a product listed on our website is
							labeled with an incorrect price due to some typographical, informational, technical or other error,
							Blinds shall at its sole discretion have the right to refuse and/or cancel any order for
							said product and immediately amend, correct and/or remove the inaccurate information.</span>
						<h2 class="h2-par">
							3.Saved Orders / Price Changes
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph"> At Blinds we strive to give our consumers the best price available
							on the products we carry. Unfortunately we are in a very volatile market, therefore prices are
							subject to change without notice. Saving an order in your account does not guarantee price. So
							please process your order quickly to ensure that you receive the best price.

							Note: Dealer orders are not covered under our satisfaction guarantee.</span>

						<h2 class="h2-par">
							4. Order Changes
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">We want to make sure you’re confident and happy with your order. To ensure you
							don’t experience any buyer’s remorse, we allow customers a 24-hour review period after your order
							is placed before sending it on to our production facility. This gives you time to correct any
							“oops!” or make any last-minute changes to your order. (If you wish to bypass the 24-hour review
							period and have your order sent directly into production, just click the “Bypass Review” button
							when you receive your order confirmation email.)

							Changes within the standard 24-hour review period can be submitted by email via our How to Make
							Changes to an Order or Contact pages. You can also call Customer Care at 888-257-1840, and one of
							our team members will be happy to adjust your order for you.

							This policy applies to products with standard production times. Most of our custom window blinds
							and shades are made in as few as 4-7 business days after an order is sent to our production
							facility. (Check the Production & Shipping tab on our product pages for your product’s production
							time.) Unfortunately, orders for or that include products with 1-3 day production times, as well as
							any orders requesting expedited shipping, cannot be changed.

							If your order is for a product with a 1-3 day production time and it is absolutely necessary to
							adjust it, we can attempt to do so before it is shipped from the production facility. If we cannot
							do so in time or you wish to cancel after production has started, you would be charged a restocking
							fee of less than the original amount of the order.</span>
