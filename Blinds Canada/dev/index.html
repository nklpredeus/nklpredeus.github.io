							SAFETY FIRST
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">Child safety is a really big deal to us. Really big. HUGE. That's why we were
							the first online retailer in our industry to offer a cordless option on every single product we
							offer, waayyyy before it became mandatory in 2018. Every. Single. Product. Because we're committed
							to helping our customers prevent the needless deaths and injuries that occur every day from
							strangulation hazards posed to children (and pets) by corded window products. That's why we offer
							free cordless options on more products than any other company.</span>
						<h2 class="h2-par">
							BLIND AMBITION
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">BLIND AMBITION
							It all started in 2003 when our founder, reverent risk-taker and lean (because he's also an extreme
							athlete) startup evangelist Rick Steele was looking for window shades to help his young daughter
							sleep better. Frustrated and floored by the high cost and hassle of finding custom window
							treatments that fit, he decided to take matters into his own hands.

							Rated one of the Best Online Shops 2020 by Newsweek magazine, we're now one of the fastest-growing
							internet retailers in the home décor industry. And we continue to grow by leaps and bounds, with
							millions of super happy customers. (Don't take our word for it. Check out their reviews.)

							Our goal? To provide a friendly, relaxed online environment where customers can find high-quality,
							budget-friendly DIY window coverings that meet their unique needs.</span>
						<h2 class="h2-par">
							HAPPY TEAM MEMBERS = HAPPY CUSTOMERS
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">Why, you ask, are our customers so happy? Because we are! We're happy because
							we get to come to work each day and have fun helping people save lots of money and time buying
							beautiful, child-safe custom window coverings. All at ridiculously affordable prices. Which makes
							them very happy.</span>


						<h2 class="h2-par">
							QUALITY, CUSTOM WINDOW COVERINGS
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">We don't want to brag, but we will. Just a little. Here are just a few of the
							shows and networks our high quality, custom window coverings have been featured on.</span>

						<h2 class="h2-par">
							WE'RE VERY INFLUENTIAL
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">We're very social, too. Designers, DIYers, popular bloggers and influencers of
							all things interior design like us. They REALLY like us! And we love being inspired by and
							collaborating with them. In fact, we're the go-to supplier of custom window treatments for dozens
							of DIY decorators who participate in the bi-annual One Room Challenge™ sponsored by Better Homes
							and Gardens.</span>

						<h2 class="h2-par">
							HOW WE CREATE YOUR CUSTOM WINDOW COVERINGS
						</h2>
						<span class="paragraph">Curious about our quality? Relax. It's the same (or better!) than the Big
							Brand Names like Hunter Douglas and Levelor. We put together this little Academy Award-winning
							video (well, we think it should be anyway) to show you just how well made your custom-crafted
							window treatments are.</span>
